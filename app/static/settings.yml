bio: >-
  My name is Andrew, but most people call me Andy.<br><br>

  I am a data scientist, coder, writer and talker. I wear a lot of hats and like to learn through doing.<br><br>
  
  I believe the best data is rare data, and I am particularly interested in data acquisition from difficult sources.<br><br>
  
  I used to DJ a lot. I am still technically signed to Tommy Boy Records.
  Before that, I did genomic research at NYU.

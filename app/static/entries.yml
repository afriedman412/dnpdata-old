  synopsis: I built a web scraper to help <a href='https://brooklynevictiondefense.org/'>Brooklyn
    Eviction Defense</a> better protect tenants from eviction. After Covid shut down
    city courts for several months, the city set up new courts to handle the backlog
    in housing court cases. These new courts often struggled to contact defendants
    about updates in their cases, especially given the pandemic upheaval. BED sought
    to find tenants at risk of missing court dates, and the scraper allowed the organization
    to do so in minutes instead of hours.
